# clojuremagick

(The cake is still getting baked)

## Why?

Why is it better than using shell command interface of imagemagic directly?

- You just need to specify an vector with the commands, no need to concatenate strings in some funky way.
- You aren't tied to imagemagick, you can use graphicsmagick as well with minimal changes.
- With a single image, you might want to have different versions of it. Clojuremagick handles that for you. (CONCURRENTLY?)
- Just specify the file and a vector with the transformations you need and get the output of that.
- Error handling.

## Examples

```clojure
; Convert a single file -- WARNING: the file will be overriden
(cm/with-file file ; Either file path or clojure.java.io/File / java.io.File
              [[:resize "100x100"]
               [:rotate "-90"]])
   
; Convert a file -- keeping the old version. The new version will be a TempFile with the thumb_rotated_small prefix.
(cm/with-temp file
  {:version :thumb-rotated-small
   :operators [[:resize "100x100"]
               [:rotate "-90"]]})

; Convert a file -- keeping the old version. The new version will be a file with the thumb_rotated_small prefix and saved in the same directory as the previous file.
(cm/with-copy file
  {:version :thumb-rotated-small
   :operators [[:resize "100x100"]
               [:rotate "-90"]]})

; Convert a file with multiple outputs (will always keep the old version). The new version will have the prefix specified as the name of the version.
(cm/with-copy file
  {:version :thumb-rotated-small
   :operators [[:resize "100x100"]
               [:rotate "-90"]]}
  {:version :thumb-big
   :operators [[:resize "250x250"]]})
```

## Roadmap

- Basic functionality: load image, call commands over it
- Proper docs
- Compatibility with GraphicsMagick
- Study the possibility of doing convertions concurrently for multiple versions
